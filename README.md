# Olivetti faces PNG set

The Olivetti face set is available through Python's Scikit-learn lib, or from the [NYU CS site](http://www.cs.nyu.edu/~roweis/data.html) as a Matlab file.

This repo contains an export (via a couple lines of Python by yours truly) of [Scikit's Olivetti face dataset](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/olivetti_faces.html) into PNG format.

My hope is that this export will come in handy for those wishing to use this data set for things like machine learning and such, but if there are copyright issues with doing something like this, please do not hesitate to contact me via direct message to [my Twitter account](https://twitter.com/meta_Lloyd)
